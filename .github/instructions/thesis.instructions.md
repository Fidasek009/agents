This section provides guidelines on writing style, citations, and typesetting for the thesis.

<text_style>
The thesis must be written in a professional style. The essential specifics compared to other functional styles (e.g., journalistic or artistic) are accuracy, clarity, emotional neutrality, and logical argumentation.

By precision we mean, above all, the choice of the correct vocabulary. Find specialist terms for your topic, define them (preferably with reference to specialist literature) and use them wherever necessary. Stick to one term, even if there are several (you can mention them, of course). Each term must have a definition, the only exceptions being terms that are familiar to the computer science community, e.g. command, program. Every abbreviation must be defined when it first appears; the only exceptions are abbreviations that are commonly known (e.g., USA, IBM). Accuracy is also related to providing verifiable data (which is a big difference from journalistic practice).

Clarity is important to help the reader navigate through a challenging text. For clarity, use decimal numbering (i.e., Chapter 1, Section 1.1, Subsection 1.1.1), cross-references ("as discussed in Section 1.2"), footnotes, numbered and referenced figures, tables, diagrams, equations in the text. Do not be afraid to refer to another part of the text in each section, remembering that technical text is rarely read coherently from beginning to end.

A professional text is emotionally neutral, i.e. it does not contain expressions of joy, regret or surprise. It does not contain an evaluation of one's own work or an appeal to the reader.

Proper logical reasoning begins with the coherence of the individual parts of the text. The basic unit of a professional text is the paragraph, but the text must also be coherent at the level of sentences and clauses (beware of long sentences that deal with multiple topics). Individual paragraphs lead to the logical construction of arguments to support your claims. For each paragraph, it must be clear why it is in the text at all.

Typical errors and problems that occur in thesis papers are as follows:

Use of slang and ungrammatical expressions (after all, too),
deviation from the professional style to the journalistic style (use of metaphors),
substitution of marketing vocabulary for technical vocabulary (e.g. frequent use of 'technology' and 'solutions' where there is a more precise term),
repetition of words (just, that is, relational pronouns),
bastardisation and incorrect use of technical terms,
use of Czech words in Slovak text ( dotaz, doporúčanie),
the accumulation of verbal nouns, i.e. forms ending in "ní" or "tí" (termination, introduction, procedure, decision),
errors in word order and cumbersome wording,
poor structure of the work (too many short chapters, uneven distribution of text between chapters),
the presence of redundant parts, e.g. the theoretical part of the thesis discusses concepts that are not used further.
</text_style>
<references_and_citations>
A bibliographic citation is a collection of information about a cited publication or part of a publication that enables its identification. A bibliographic citation is distinguished from a reference to a citation, which is a reference in the text to a citation given elsewhere. The rules for the creation of bibliographic citations and their inclusion in scientific publications are given in CSN 01 0197. A detailed analysis of the creation of citations can be found, for example, in the publications on Elportal. In computer science, a common style of citation is by using serial numbers (e.g. [1]) , but referencing by name and year of publication (e.g. [Gruber, 1969]) or by abbreviation (e.g. [Gru68]) can also be used, but always uniformly.

The most common errors in dealing with the literature include:

Inadequate range of literature work, or insufficient quality or variety of sources (e.g. overuse of Wikipedia - see later in this tab),
inconsistency of citations (e.g. some citations give the first name of the author and others do not, different typesetting styles for different items),
Missing information in citations (e.g. conference name for conference papers, timestamp for electronic resources),
not referencing in-text citations.

A typical problem is the excessive use of web resources and specifically Wikipedia. A few comments on this issue:

One of the goals of the thesis is to demonstrate that you can work with scholarly sources. If (almost) all references are to Wikipedia, then you are not demonstrating this ability very much.
Quality Wikipedia articles usually contain links to original sources. Try to find a relevant primary source and cite that directly.
There are cases where it may be relevant to cite Wikipedia (e.g., we want to refer the reader to a well-developed discussion of a concept that is important to understanding the paper), but in most cases it is more relevant to cite, for example, an original technical article, a technical standard, or a standard textbook on the topic.

<typesetting>
Pay attention to typographic principles, common mistakes include:

Incorrect quotation marks,
ignoring the difference between a hyphen and a hyphen or hyphenation,
inappropriate line and page breaks (widows and orphans),
incorrect spacing of punctuation marks and quotations,
inconsistent use of punctuation in lists and captions of figures or tables.
